# Simple Demonstration Logger

This class demonstrates how to write a module, in this case a simple logger. The logger supports various log levels you would expect like DEBUG, INFO, and so on.

The logger is easy to use too:

```
const logger = require('makoto-logger');

logger.info('Greetings');
```

This module will evolve as I use it in more tutorials.

Cheers,
